## Description

The Note Taker app is designed for busy individuals, especially small business owners, seeking an efficient way to capture and organize thoughts and tasks. Upon launch, users are directed to an intuitive interface where existing notes are listed on the left and a space to create new notes on the right. As notes are penned, a "Save" icon ensures immediate storage. Selecting an existing note allows for easy review, and with the "Write" icon, users can swiftly transition back to crafting new entries. In short, Note Taker is a digital ally for optimal organization and task management.
